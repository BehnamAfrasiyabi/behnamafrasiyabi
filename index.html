            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in the design and development of embedded systems for various applications. During my university education, I built a system for managing home appliances using a cell phone with a smart home approach. After that, I designed a device for testing and simulation of in-vehicle sensors, and I have been involved in a project to build a car tester and ECU troubleshooter. After graduation, I started my career working in the field of manufacturing, production, and soldering of industrial boards. Currently, I am a member of the MAPNA Automation and Process Control System (MAPCS). MAPCS is the state-of-the-art FCS/DCS system of MAPNA Electric & Control (MECO) Company. Design and development of hardware for industrial devices and components such as Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and various industrial I/O cards are some examples of projects I work on.</p>
